Relaxed lo-fi beats paired with jazzy piano and warm bass.
[0:11] The track begins with a gentle, smooth beat—a soft, almost muffled kick drum with delicate hi-hats, giving it a relaxed rhythm. A jazzy piano enters with simple, comforting chords that flows naturally. 
[11:19] The piano becomes vert intricate and melodic, still keeping within a jazzy or soulful style.  The lo-fi beat continues, but the drums could develop more character—slightly offbeat and with extra texture (such as vinyl crackles or field recordings)—to enhance the nostalgic feel.
[19:30] The music revisits the relaxed, minimal elements. The piano returns to simpler. The lo-fi beat fade out, leaving a subtle soundscape or atmospheric background noise to close out the track. The overall instrumentation becomes quieter, as if the track is slowly winding down to a peaceful conclusion.
